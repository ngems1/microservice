# Connect GitHub to AWS (bootstrap)

Everything in AWS is created by GitHub Actions, except **one login role** that has to exist first. Otherwise GitHub would have no way in. This guide is that one-time setup: about 15 minutes of clicks, then two workflow runs.

```
You (once, in the console):  GitHub OIDC provider + week3-bootstrap role
        ↓
bootstrap workflow (Terraform):  state bucket + week3-gha-plan + week3-gha-deploy
        ↓
infra / deploy workflows:  everything else, with the plan or deploy role
```

| Role | Created by | Used by | Rights |
|---|---|---|---|
| `week3-bootstrap` | You, by hand | `bootstrap` workflow, only in the protected `prod` environment | Admin (it creates IAM roles) |
| `week3-gha-plan` | bootstrap workflow | Pull-request plans | Read-only, plus the Terraform state lock |
| `week3-gha-deploy` | bootstrap workflow | `main` branch, `dev` / `prod` environments | Admin (applies Terraform, deploys) |

So a pull request from any branch can only **read**. Changes need a merge to `main` or an approved environment.

## 1. GitHub: create the environments

Repo > **Settings > Environments > New environment**:

1. Create **`dev`** with no rules.
2. Create **`prod`**. Tick **Required reviewers** and add yourself.

On a **private** repo with a free GitHub plan, required reviewers aren't available. Either make the repo public (it contains no secrets) or skip the reviewer; everything else still works.

## 2. AWS console: GitHub login provider

Region **us-east-1**. **IAM > Identity providers > Add provider**:

1. **Provider type:** OpenID Connect.
2. **Provider URL:** `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
3. **Audience:** `sts.amazonaws.com`. Click **Add provider**.

If it already exists, skip this step: only one is allowed per account.

## 3. AWS console: the bootstrap role

1. **IAM > Roles > Create role > Custom trust policy**.
2. Paste this, replacing `<ACCOUNT_ID>` (12 digits, top-right menu), `<OWNER>` (your GitHub username) and `<REPO>` (repo name, same upper/lower case as on GitHub):

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [{
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Principal": { "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com" },
       "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
       "Condition": {
         "StringEquals": {
           "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com",
           "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:<OWNER>/<REPO>:environment:prod"
         }
       }
     }]
   }
   ```

   The `environment:prod` part means only jobs running in the protected `prod` environment can use this role.

3. **Next**, then tick **AdministratorAccess**, then **Next**.
4. **Name:** `week3-bootstrap`. Click **Create role**, then copy its **ARN**.
5. Back in GitHub: **Settings > Environments > prod > Environment variables > Add variable**:
   - `AWS_BOOTSTRAP_ROLE_ARN` = the ARN you copied

## 4. GitHub: repository variables

**Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Variables > New repository variable**:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `AWS_REGION` | `us-east-1` |
| `ADMIN_PRINCIPAL_ARN` | Your IAM user's ARN (**IAM > Users > you**), for `kubectl` access to the cluster. Not the root user. |

## 5. Run the bootstrap workflow

1. **Actions > bootstrap > Run workflow**, with **apply unchecked**. If `prod` has a reviewer, approve the run. Open the run's **Summary** and read the plan: it should create the bucket and 2 roles.
2. **Run workflow** again, with **apply checked**. Approve the run.
3. The run's **Summary** ends with a table. Add each line as a **repository variable**:
   `AWS_PLAN_ROLE_ARN`, `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN`, `TF_STATE_BUCKET`. `AWS_REGION` is already set.

Then continue with SETUP.md step 5 (`infra` > `apply`).

## If something goes wrong

| Error | Fix |
|---|---|
| "Set the AWS_BOOTSTRAP_ROLE_ARN variable" | The variable must be on the **prod environment**, not the repository (step 3.5) |
| `Not authorized to perform sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` | Compare the `sub` printed in the step "Show the identity GitHub presents to AWS" with the trust policy (step 3.2). Case and spelling must match exactly. |
| `No OpenIDConnect provider found` | Step 2 is missing, or was done in another AWS account |
| A run failed half-way | Run it again: resources that already exist are imported, not duplicated |

## Security notes (for the demo)

- **No keys anywhere:** GitHub gets credentials valid for at most 2 hours, through OIDC.
- **Least privilege:** pull requests can't change anything (`week3-gha-plan` is read-only).
- **Admin rights are gated:** the admin roles only work from `main` or a protected environment.
- **Remediation item:** `week3-gha-deploy` still has AdministratorAccess. Next step would be a policy limited to the services Terraform uses. You can also delete `week3-bootstrap` after this setup and recreate it only when the bootstrap changes.
